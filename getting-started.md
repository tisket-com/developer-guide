# Getting Started

Welcome to the Developer Guide!

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the development server

## Next Steps

Check out the following guides:
- [Features](./features.md)
- [API Reference](./api/overview.md)
- [Architecture](./architecture.md)

## What’s Next

Once you’ve completed the Quick Start, you can dive deeper into the platform:

- Explore **Features** to understand what’s available and how different components fit together.
- Review the **API Reference** for detailed information on endpoints, authentication, and request/response formats.
- Read through the **Architecture** guide to learn how the system is structured and how data flows through it.

From here, you should be ready to start building, extending, or integrating with the platform.

## Testing Updates

This section exists to verify that documentation changes are correctly written, committed, and reflected in Tisket. If you can see this section, the update pipeline is working as expected.
